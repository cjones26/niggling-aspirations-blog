This is a bit of an irritating error, with a simple solution:

> /proc/misc: No entry for device-mapper found
> Is device-mapper driver missing from kernel?
> Failure to communicate with kernel device-mapper driver.
> Added Linux \*

First of all, we need to make sure that our kernel configuration has `Device Drivers->Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM)` compiled in, with Device Mapper Support as a module.

Once device mapper support is compiled in as a module, if we still receive the error, we can run:

```
sudo modprobe dm_mod
sudo /sbin/lilo
```

The errors should now be gone:

> Added Linux \*

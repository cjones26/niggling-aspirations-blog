Had some trouble with something I'd had earlier trouble with in the past. When using the locate command (even after running updatedb), I was unable to search my removable USB drives.

The solution was to modify the `/etc/updatedb.conf` file, and remove `/media` from the prune path:

```
PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS="yes"
# PRUNENAMES=".git .bzr .hg .svn"
PRUNEPATHS="/tmp /var/spool /media"
PRUNEFS="NFS nfs nfs4 rpc_pipefs afs binfmt_misc proc smbfs autofs iso9660 ncpfs coda devpts ftpfs devfs mfs shfs sysfs cifs lustre_lite tmpfs usbfs udf"
```

Guess this was more a mental note to myself :).

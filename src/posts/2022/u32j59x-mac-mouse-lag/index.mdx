It's been a whlie since I've posted, but I recently received a nice Samsung 32 inch monitor from work and attempted to hook it to my MacBook M1 Pro.  

After doing so, I noticed some *extreme* mouse lag, and after checking my display settings, I realized that I was only getting a 30Hz refresh rate.  After a bit of searching, I came across the post [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253620760).

Turns out, only HDMI2 supports 60Hz, for some reason or another 🤷🏻‍♂️.
